<p>In conclusion, I believe that this portfolio helped me develop a complete understanding of basic trigonometry. The various entries demonstrate different aspects of trigonometry, and together they demonstrate full proficiency. In addition, the creative piece and real world trig entries demonstrate practical applications of this knowledge. The solid trigonometry foundation developed through this trig portfolio will assist my future mathematical studies.</p>
<p>I feel that I placed a good effort into this portfolio. Some entries were collected out of my notebook where possible, but in other cases I created content specifically for this portfolio. I attempted to keep these entries as neat, readable, and understandable as possible, so that it could be kept as a future study aid.</p>
<p>In the future, I hope to be able to refer to this portfolio for review of trigonometric concepts, while expanding upon the knowledge with additional concepts.</p>

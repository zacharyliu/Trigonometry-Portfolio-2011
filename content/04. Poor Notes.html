<p>These notes are unorganized and thus can be difficult to study from. Since it is not labeled, it is unclear what the triangles in the center of the page are demonstrating. While it does record bits of information from class, these bits of information are scattered and unrelated, with no clear indication of their relationship.</p>
<p>In the future, I will attempt to better organize and label my notes, so that they are easier to study from and so they can be understood by others.</p>
